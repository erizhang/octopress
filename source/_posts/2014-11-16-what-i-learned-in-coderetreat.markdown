We're now the 3rd times hosting and facilitating the Global Day of Coderetreat in Hangzhou, China. Compared with Jim Hurne coordinating the globally events, be frankly, our work is easier. Yes, it's easier, but I do not think it's not important. It always request the host and facilitator spends much more effort to prepare and continuiously improve. Personally, beside those Global Day of Coderetreat (GDCR in short), we still spended much time hosting and facilitating such like coding dojo, coding rally etc. which help to programmer practice their software design, coding skill and agile engineering practices. Here I'd like to share what I learned from coderetreat.

## Prepare as earlier as possible

Even coderetreat's organizing is lightweight compares what's conference. But prepare as earler as possible makes sense. What're you have to prepare:

- Keep the connection with coderetreat.org, and keep you can touch the global organizer via email, if you hosted the GDCR in last year, you mail will be record in historial host naming lsit. So that, you can received first hand news from coderetreat community, about the schedule, host and faclitate guideline, experience sharing, some issues discussion. This is great opportunity to learn from expereienced person, also it's great time to build your reputation.

- Join regional GDCR community.

- look for the sponsors
